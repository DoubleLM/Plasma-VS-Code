                <h2>01 | New CSS Feature</h2>
                <h4>CSS caret-color</h4>
                <p>The caret-color property allows the color to be set of the caret
                    (blinking cursor) in an input field. This property is useful for
                    setting the color of the caret to match the text color of the input
                    field. The caret-color property is supported in all major browsers
                    except Internet Explorer.
                </p>
                <p>I like this property because not only is it objectively funny to mess with, it
                    also allows for more variety with background design and can be used to
                    better contrast against "dark mode" backgrounds. It's a small detail
                    that can make a big difference in the overall look of a website.
                </p>

            <h2>02 | My Favourite Learned CSS Feature</h2>
            <p>My favourite CSS feature that I've learned so far has to be the flexible
                box model. It's a simple and intuitive way to lay out, align, and
                distribute space among items in a container, even when their size is
                unknown or dynamic. It's a great way to create complex layouts with
                minimal code and is supported in all major browsers.
            </p>
            <p>Furthermore, I've also learned how to make it responsive in its design,
                which is a great way to make sure that the layout looks good on all sorts
                of devices and screen sizes. Check it out for yourself by resizing this
                window and paying attention to the Flags I Like section! It'll transform
                from four columns down to two. This is thanks to code I learned on W3Schools.
            </p>
            <p>(special shoutout to linear gradient backgrounds, I adore that old school stuff)</p>

                <h2>03 | AI and Web Development</h2>
                <p>Artificial Intelligence makes for a dangerous companion to have in the
                    field of web development, at least during its current infancy. Its lack
                    of abject reliability is a major drawback, but its potential for quickly
                    filling out the minutiae for you is a major boon. It's a double-edged sword
                    that developers will have to decide for themselves whether they would like
                    to play with or not.
                </p>
                <p>As an example of Artificial Intelligence at work, the following paragraph (in blue)
                    was AI-generated by GitHub Copilot. It's certainly a bit of a mess, but it's a start
                    for someone who wishes to fill out a website with placeholder text.
                </p>
                <p style="color: darkblue">
                    Artificial intelligence (AI) is a rapidly growing field that has the
                    potential to revolutionize web development. AI can be used to create
                    more personalized and engaging user experiences, optimize website
                    performance, and automate repetitive tasks. AI-powered tools can help
                    developers build smarter websites that are more responsive to user
                    needs and preferences.
